It will perform a `npm run build-image` action , that takes COMMIT SHA and builds a new image with a tag of COMMIT SHA.
Later it will use `infra/deploy-staging.sh` to apply new `deployment.yaml` configuration with new COMMIT SHA.

Note: If you will update code without commiting it change, commit sha wont get changed , so it won't deploy the change.
